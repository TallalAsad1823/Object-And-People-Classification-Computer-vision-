# Object and People Classification – Computer Vision

This repository contains an implementation based on the YOLOv8 model for object and people classification tasks in computer vision. The project is used for learning, experimentation, and practical understanding of real-time object detection systems.

## About

YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once) is a state-of-the-art deep learning model for object detection and classification. It enables fast and accurate detection of multiple objects within images or video streams.

This repository is a practice-based adaptation of the original YOLOv8 implementation by Ultralytics.

## Purpose

- Understanding object detection workflows  
- Learning model inference and deployment  
- Exploring real-time classification systems  

## Credits
